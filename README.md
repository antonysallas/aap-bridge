# AAP Bridge

A production-grade Python tool for migrating Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
installations from one version to another, designed to handle large-scale
migrations (e.g., 80,000+ hosts)

## Features

- **Bulk Operations**: Leverages AAP bulk APIs for high-performance migrations
- **State Management**: PostgreSQL-backed state tracking with checkpoint/resume
  capability
- **Idempotency**: Safely resume interrupted migrations without creating
  duplicates
- **Professional Progress Display**: Rich-based live progress display with
  real-time metrics (rate, success/fail counts, timing)
- **Flexible Output Modes**: Normal, quiet, CI/CD, and detailed modes for
  different environments
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with separate console (WARNING)
  and file (DEBUG) levels
- **Split-File Export/Import**: Automatic file splitting for large datasets with
  metadata tracking
- **CLI Interface**: Intuitive Click-based CLI with extensive options and
  environment variable support

## Architecture

The tool is organized into several key components:

- **Client Layer**: HTTP clients for source AAP, target AAP, and HashiCorp Vault
  with retry logic and rate limiting
- **Migration Layer**: ETL pipeline with exporters, transformers, and importers
  for all AAP resource types
- **State Management**: Database-backed progress tracking, checkpoint creation,
  and ID mapping
- **CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface for all operations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** or higher
- **PostgreSQL** database (Required for state management)
- **Hardware**: Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for large migrations
- **Network**: Access to Source AAP, Target AAP, and the state management
  PostgreSQL database (not AAP)
- **Credentials**: Admin access to both Source and Target AAP instances
- **HashiCorp Vault** (Optional but recommended): For migrating encrypted
  credentials securely

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antonysallas/aap-bridge.git
cd aap-bridge

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --seed --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

2. **Install dependencies and editable package:**
This command will create/update your virtual environment, install all dependencies (including development dependencies), and install the `aap-bridge` package in editable mode.

uv sync

### Configuration

The project includes configuration files with recommended default values. You need to set up your environment variables for AAP credentials and the database.

#### 1. Database Setup

The tool requires a PostgreSQL database to track migration state. You must create this database before running the tool. The tool will automatically create the necessary tables on first run.

```bash

# Example: Create database and user locally
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE aap_migration;"
psql -c "CREATE USER aap_migration_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';"
psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE aap_migration TO aap_migration_user;"
# Ensure the user owns the schema/tables (Postgres 15+)
psql -d aap_migration -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO aap_migration_user;"

```dockerfile

#### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your credentials:

```bash

cp .env.example .env

```text

Edit `.env` with your AAP instance details and database connection string.

**Critical AAP 2.6 Note:** The Target URL must point to the **Platform Gateway** (`/api/controller/v2`), not the direct controller API.

```bash

# Source AAP instance
SOURCE__URL=https://source-aap.example.com/api/v2
SOURCE__TOKEN=your_source_token

# Target AAP instance (Platform Gateway)
TARGET__URL=https://target-aap.example.com/api/controller/v2
TARGET__TOKEN=your_target_token

# PostgreSQL state database (REQUIRED)
MIGRATION_STATE_DB_PATH=postgresql://aap_migration_user:your_secure_password@localhost:5432/aap_migration

# HashiCorp Vault (Optional)
# If configured, the tool can inject credentials. If skipped, credentials must
be manually recreated.
VAULT__URL=https://vault.example.com
VAULT__ROLE_ID=xxxxx
VAULT__SECRET_ID=xxxxx

```markdown

#### 3. Application Configuration

Review and adjust `config/config.yaml` for your environment:

- **Performance settings**: Adjust batch sizes and concurrency based on your AAP instance capacity
- **Logging**: Configure log levels and file paths
- **Migration phases**: Enable/disable specific resource types

1. Update `config/mappings.yaml` if you need to rename resources during migration (e.g., credential types with different names between AAP versions).

### Usage

#### Basic Commands

```bash

# Menu Based CLI
aap-bridge

# Migrate full AAP
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

# Export from source AAP only
aap-bridge export all --output exports/

# Import to target AAP only
aap-bridge import inventories --input exports/inventories.json

# Validate migration
aap-bridge validate all --sample-size 4000

# View migration report
aap-bridge report summary

```markdown

#### Output Control

The tool provides flexible output modes for different environments:

```bash

# Default: Live progress display with clean console output
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

# Quiet mode: Errors only (for scripting)
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --quiet

# Disable progress: For CI/CD environments
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --disable-progress

# Detailed stats: Show additional metrics
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --show-stats

# Combination: Quiet + no progress for automation
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --quiet --disable-progress

```text

**Output Modes:**

- **Normal** (default): Live progress display with real-time metrics, WARNING-level console logs
- **Quiet** (`--quiet`): Minimal output, errors only
- **CI/CD** (`--disable-progress`): No live display, structured logs suitable for CI pipelines
- **Detailed** (`--show-stats`): Additional statistics and timing information

**Environment Variables:**

```bash

# Configure via environment
export AAP_BRIDGE__LOGGING__CONSOLE_LEVEL=WARNING
export AAP_BRIDGE__LOGGING__DISABLE_PROGRESS=true
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

```markdown

#### Split-File Export/Import

For large datasets, the tool automatically splits exports into multiple files:

```bash

# Export with custom split size (default: 1000 records/file)
aap-bridge export --output exports/ --records-per-file 500

# Import handles multiple files automatically
aap-bridge import --input exports/

```text

**Export Structure:**

```text

exports/
├── metadata.json           # Export metadata
├── organizations/
│   └── organizations_0001.json
├── inventories/
│   ├── inventories_0001.json  # 1000 records
│   ├── inventories_0002.json  # 1000 records
│   └── inventories_0003.json  # Remaining records
└── hosts/
    ├── hosts_0001.json
    └── hosts_0002.json

```markdown

## Performance Targets (TBD)

- **Migration Rate**:
- **API Request Rate**:
- **Memory Usage**:
- **Total Time**:

## Key Design Principles

### Bulk Operations

The tool uses AAP's bulk operations API to dramatically improve performance:

- Hosts: 200 per request (API maximum)
- Inventories: 100 per batch
- Credentials: 50 per batch

### Checkpoint Recovery

All migrations are checkpoint-based, allowing safe resumption:

```bash

# Resume from last checkpoint
aap-bridge migrate resume

# Resume from specific checkpoint
aap-bridge migrate resume --checkpoint inventories_batch_50

```markdown

### Idempotency

The tool tracks all migrated resources in a state database, ensuring that running the migration multiple times is safe and won't create duplicates.

## Migration Order

The tool migrates resources in the correct dependency order:

1. Organizations, Labels, Users, Teams
2. Credential Types, Credentials
3. Projects, Execution Environments
4. Inventories (bulk operations)
5. Hosts (bulk operations, 200/batch)
6. Job Templates, Workflows
7. RBAC role assignments

## Critical Constraints

### Encrypted Credentials

**Important**: Encrypted credentials cannot be extracted from source AAP via API. Passwords, SSH keys, and secret fields will show as `$encrypted$`.

**Solution**: Credentials must be manually recreated in HashiCorp Vault before migration.

### Platform Gateway

AAP 2.6 routes all API calls through the Platform Gateway at `https://<gateway>/api/controller/v2/`. The tool automatically handles this routing.
