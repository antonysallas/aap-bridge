# AAP Bridge

A production-grade Python tool for migrating Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
installations from one version to another, designed to handle large-scale
migrations (e.g., 80,000+ hosts).

## Key Features

- **Bulk Operations** - Leverages AAP bulk APIs for high-performance migrations
- **State Management** - PostgreSQL-backed state tracking with checkpoint/resume
  capability
- **Idempotency** - Safely resume interrupted migrations without creating
  duplicates
- **Professional Progress Display** - Rich-based live progress with real-time
  metrics
- **Flexible Output Modes** - Normal, quiet, CI/CD, and detailed modes
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Structured logging with separate console and file
  levels
- **Split-File Export/Import** - Automatic file splitting for large datasets

## Architecture Overview

AAP Bridge follows an ETL (Export, Transform, Load) architecture:

    A[Source AAP<br/>2.3/2.4] -->|Export| B[AAP Bridge<br/>ETL Engine]
    B -->|Load| C[Target AAP<br/>2.6+]

    style D fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#6a1b9a,stroke-width:2px
```

**Components:**

- **Client Layer** - HTTP clients for source AAP, target AAP, and HashiCorp
  Vault
- **Migration Layer** - ETL pipeline with exporters, transformers, and importers
- **State Management** - Database-backed progress tracking and ID mapping
- **CLI** - User-friendly command-line interface

## Migration Order

Resources are migrated in dependency order:

1. Organizations, Labels, Users, Teams
2. Credential Types, Credentials
3. Execution Environments
4. Inventories, Inventory Sources, Inventory Groups
5. Hosts (bulk operations)
6. Instances, Instance Groups
7. Projects
8. Job Templates, Workflows
9. Schedules
