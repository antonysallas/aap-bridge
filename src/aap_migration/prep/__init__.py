"""AAP Migration Prep Module.

This module handles the discovery of endpoints and generation of schemas
from AAP 2.3 (source) and AAP 2.6 (target) instances.

The prep phase produces:
- source_endpoints.json: All discovered endpoints from source AAP
- target_endpoints.json: All discovered endpoints from target AAP
- source_schema.json: Complete schema for source AAP
- target_schema.json: Complete schema for target AAP
- schema_comparison.json: Diff and transformation rules
